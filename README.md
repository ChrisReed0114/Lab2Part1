#### -I am considering making a tutroial/data base for learning how to use a program I have encountered in the past. I am between two different programs I am decididing between are Latex and Jupyter. I use Latex frequently as a text editor and I want to learn how to use it proficiently. I have used a lot of help from online wikis and tutotrials but most of this information is scattered and can feel overwhelming. I would want to make some sort of interface or compose a combination of writing intrcutions and examples to show how to use Latex as a beginner. Jupyter is something I have not used in over a year but like Latex, it has a steep learning curve and the infromation online is very scattered. I used it in Physics II Honors when I wasa physics major. I would be less familiar with this interface now but I feel as though I may have more experience with this than computer science majors, having at one point needing it for a class.
